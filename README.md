## Trend and Performance Analysis:
Identifying peak sales periods (e.g., time of day, days of the week).
Analyzing seasonal trends and customer buying behavior.

## Key Metrics:
Calculating total revenue, average daily sales, and contribution of each product or category.
Determining the top-selling products and slow-moving items.

## Insights and Recommendations:
